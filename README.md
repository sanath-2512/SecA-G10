## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the **Big Mart Sales Dataset**. By leveraging data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques, we aim to understand the factors that impact sales across various product categories and outlet types. Our goal is to provide a clear, data-driven dashboard that helps stakeholders identify high-performing segments and areas for improvement.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- **Identify Sales Drivers:** Analyze which item characteristics (MRP, Type, Visibility) influence sales.
- **Outlet Performance:** Compare sales across different outlet sizes, types, and locations.
- **Predictive Foundation:** Prepare a clean, structured dataset suitable for future predictive modeling.
- **Insightful Visualization:** Build a dynamic dashboard for real-time business decision-making.

### 1. Data Cleaning (The "Grunt Work")
- **Handling Missing Data:** usage of `AVERAGEIF` for Item Weight and `MODE` for Outlet Size.
- **Standardizing Labels:** Correcting "LF", "low fat" -> "Low Fat".
- **Sanity Checks:** Removing duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Deep-Dive Analysis
- **Pivot Tables:** Used to aggregate sales data by *Item Type*, *Outlet Location*, and *Outlet Type*.
- **Metrics Calculated:** Total Sales, Average Sales per Item, Outlet Performance Index.

### 3. Dashboard Construction
- Integrated slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Designed a color-coded heatmap for regional performance.
